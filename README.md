# Khonsu

## Introduction
Experiment to try out Leaflet Heatmap library. Using the places data I exported from Moves App.

## Running it
Run the ```khonus.py``` to generate the ```places.js``` for the leaflet heatmap.

The generated file is placed in public directory which contains all the files.

## Demo
